    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This recipe for Filipino adobo is salty, vinegary, and incredibly easy to make. 
        It’s also a great jumping-off point for making a version of your own that your whole family will adore. 
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Chicken</strong>. I’m partial to chicken drumsticks in my Filipino adobo (it’s how I mostly ate it when I was growing up), 
            but it’s equally great with bone-in chicken thighs. You can go all in on one or the other, or use a mix. </li>
        <li><strong>Seasonings</strong>. Garlic, dried bay leaves, and whole black peppercorns form the flavorful foundation of this dish. 
            I call for 5 cloves of garlic here, but it’s really just a starting point. 
            The same goes for the bay leaves and black peppercorns — you can always add in more. </li>
        <li><strong>Soy Sauce</strong>. The addition of soy sauce makes this version of adobo (known as Adobong Itim or black adobo) the one most people are familiar with.
             I keep Silver Swan soy sauce, a Filipino brand, on hand primarily for making adobo.
             It’s thinner in body, darker in color, and tastes just like home.</li>
        <li><strong>Vinegar</strong>. Similar to my preference in soy sauce, I recommend using cane vinegar when making adobo.
             It’s the most commonly used vinegar in the Philippines. Made from fermented sugarcane syrup, its mild flavor perfectly complements the adobo. </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk soy sauce, jalapeno peppers, and garlic together in a large glass or ceramic bowl. Add chicken wings and toss to evenly coat.
             Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Remove chicken wings from the marinade and shake off excess. Reserve marinade.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Place chicken wings in the hot oil and pan-fry for 2 minutes per side.
             Slowly pour in reserved marinade (including garlic) and water. Bring to a boil. Add bay leaves and peppercorns and simmer until chicken is tender, about 20 minutes.
             An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Stir in vinegar and cook for 5 minutes. Stir again and season with sugar and salt to taste. Serve hot.</li>
    </ol>
