    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This recipe for Filipino adobo is salty, vinegary, and incredibly easy to make. 
        It’s also a great jumping-off point for making a version of your own that your whole family will adore. 
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Chicken</strong>. I’m partial to chicken drumsticks in my Filipino adobo (it’s how I mostly ate it when I was growing up), 
            but it’s equally great with bone-in chicken thighs. You can go all in on one or the other, or use a mix. </li>
        <li><strong>Seasonings</strong>. Garlic, dried bay leaves, and whole black peppercorns form the flavorful foundation of this dish. 
            I call for 5 cloves of garlic here, but it’s really just a starting point. 
            The same goes for the bay leaves and black peppercorns — you can always add in more. </li>
        <li><strong>Soy Sauce</strong>. The addition of soy sauce makes this version of adobo (known as Adobong Itim or black adobo) the one most people are familiar with.
             I keep Silver Swan soy sauce, a Filipino brand, on hand primarily for making adobo.
             It’s thinner in body, darker in color, and tastes just like home.</li>
        <li><strong>Vinegar</strong>. Similar to my preference in soy sauce, I recommend using cane vinegar when making adobo.
             It’s the most commonly used vinegar in the Philippines. Made from fermented sugarcane syrup, its mild flavor perfectly complements the adobo. </li>
    </ul>
